	abstract = {In many open source software projects (e.g., the Linux
			kernel), people contribute by sending code patches to
		the community. The community evaluates these contributions and
		decides whether to integrate the changes. To improve the
		efficiency of code contributions, substantial effort has been
		devoted to analyzing how patches are submitted and processed.
		Patch data are critical for this type of analysis, while
		retrieving and cleaning the data is a non-trivial job. To
		facilitate these studies, we share a multi-level dataset of a
		Linux kernel patchwork covering a nine-year history of patches
		and related discussion recorded by the Linux kernel mailing list
		(LKML). The data and scripts are provided at:
