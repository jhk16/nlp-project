\begin{abstract}
	Many researchers and industries conducted a study for popular programming
	languages such as Python
	and JavaScripat.
	But, the relatively fewer focused programming language like
	C/C++ has lacks of study aspect of natural language processing. I found
	this skewed situation for many used PL has more
	dataset. To overcome this starvation of NL-PL pair dataset for
	low-level PL, we need to find more dataset for low-level PL,
	such as Linux Kernel Mailing List. By collecting dataset from
	the kernel patchwork mailing list, we could see more room for
	c languages such as code summarization and generation and
	sentimental analysis for source reviewers.
