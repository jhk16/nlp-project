\begin{abstract}
	A study for popular programming language such as Python and JavaScripat
	conducted by many researchers and industry. But, the relatively fewer
	focused programming language like C/C++ has lack of study aspect of
	natural language processing. I found this skewd situtation for many used
	PL has more dataset. To overcome this starvation of NL-PL pair dataset
	for low-level PL, we need to find more dataset for low-level PL, such
	as Linux Kernel Mailing List.
	By collecting dataset from kernel pathwork mailing list, we could be
	find more room for c language such as code summarization and generation
	and sentimental analysis for source reviewer.
