\section{Conclusion}
We surveyed dataset for question and answer to generate code as an answer, which
mainly focused on popular programmin language such ash python and JavaScript.
Although computer system related PL has lack of users compared to othre popular
PL, there also is helpful to users making dataset. By using existing dataset for
Linux Kernel Mailing List dataset, we have more possibliity to data processing
with neural network and code generation and summarization, and sestimental
analysis for kernel developers.
