\section{Conclusion}
We surveyed the dataset for a question and answer to generate code as an answer,
which mainly focused on popular
a programming language such as Python and JavaScript. Although computer
system-related PL lacks users compared to other popular PL, there is also
helpful to users making dataset. By using an existing dataset for the Linux
Kernel Mailing List dataset, we have more possibility to data processing
with the neural network, code generation and summarization, and sentimental
analysis for kernel developers.
