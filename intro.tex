\section{Introduction}
\noindent
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is hot-topic of the computer science academic,
and fastly innovated and studied to various field. With the advanced neural
network, many prior work tried to investigate relationship between programming
language and natural language.
As a result, code generation with open source question and answer of community
like Stack overflow and code summarization.

However, Question and Answer dataset from Stack overflow users are skewed
becuase of popular Programming languange exist. Python is varioulsy used from
Machine Learning researcher, Data Scientist and web programmers, due to
intuition and more comprehensive than other language. JavaScript is also popular 
used to Web programmers. For these reason, Stack Overflow dataset has amount of
their information.

For system software programmers like Linux kernel developers, they commit the
their code modification for Kenrel source code and othres review the commit
and give some opinion for patch. Kernel maintainer decide whether affect this
patch to kernel mainline tree or not. This flow of kernel patchwork is recored
to Linux Kenrle Mailing List(LKML) because they used mail to commit the kernel
patch.

With this data in LKML, we can find the positive and negative comment for patch
commit and code summarization for difference of code then before, and we also
have a room for generating code related optimization and fixiation of kernel
bug.
