\section{Introduction}
\noindent
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hot topic of the computer science
academic, and fastly innovated and studied to
various field. With the advanced neural network, much prior
work investigated the relationship between programming
language and natural language. As a result, code generation
with open source questions and community answers like
Stack overflow and code summarization.

However, Stack overflow users' Question and Answer dataset is skewed because
popular Programming languages exist. Machine Learning variously uses Python
researchers, Data scientists, and web programmers due
to intuition and is more comprehensive than other languages.
JavaScript is also popularly used by Web programmers. For
these reasons, the Stack Overflow dataset has its information.

System software programmers like Linux kernel developers commit their code
modification for Kernel source code, and others review the commit and give some
opinion for a patch. Kernel maintainer decides whether affect
this patch to mainline kernel tree or not. This flow of kernel
patchwork is recorded to Linux Kernel Mailing List(LKML)
because they used the mail to commit the kernel patch.
With this data in LKML, we can find the positive and negative comments for patch
commit and code summarization
for the difference of code than before, and we also have a room
for generating code-related optimization and fixation of kernel bugs.
